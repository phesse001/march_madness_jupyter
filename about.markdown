# What is Binder?
Binder allows you to take an existing GitHub repository containing Jupyter notebooks and create a snapshot of the environment that your 

project was built in. With a single environment.yml or requirements.txt file, you are able to host your notebooks on the web 

*interactively*. Visit the documentation page for details on how to use binder.
