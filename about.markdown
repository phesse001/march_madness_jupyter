# What is Binder?
Binder allows you to take an existing GitHub repository containing Jupyter notebooks and create a snapshot of the environment that your project was built in. With a single environment.yml or requirements.txt file, you are able to host your notebooks on the web *interactively*. Visit the documentation page for details on how to use binder.
