    "content": ". Documentation . Here you will find everything you need to get started with using binder. . Getting Started . First, you will need to have a GitHub repository containing at least one Jupyter notebook and one environment.yml file. . Here is a sample of what a ‘binderized’ repository would look like . ├── environment.yml . ├── index.ipynb . └── README.md . The two required files are . .yml file | .ipynb file | . Where the .yml file will specify an anaconda environment . And the .ipynb is any Jupyter notebook . Setting Up the .yml File . Click Here to find information on how to set up a .yml file for your purposes . This file can also be created automatically . conda env export --from-history -f environment.yml . While not garunteeded to be perfect, if you are working within a specific environment, this will capture all the dependencies in that environment. You can also run this command and go back and remove any dependencies you may not need or specify particular versions. . For Example: . name: example-environment channels: - conda dependencies: -example-package=3.5.2 . Building the Image with Binder . Now that you have a GitHub repository with whatever notbooks you want to use and the environment.yml specifying the environment in which the notebooks were created, you are ready to build and deploy the image with your work. . Head to mybinder.org and you should see the following . . Copy and paste the url to the repository you just created and you are ready to launch! If you launch with just the url filled in, after the build completes you will be redirected to Jupyter server containing everything from your GitHub repository. . You can edit on any of the files and execute any of the notebooks. These changes will only occur on the server side and will not affect the state of the files in the GitHub repository. . You also have the option to specify a path to a notebook. If you fill in this argument, once the image is built, instead of being redirected to a view of your GitHub Repository in Jupyter, you will be redirected directly to the notebook you specified. .

    "content": "March Madness Simulation . This example is a sports ranking simulation based on the 1998 undergraduate thesis of Kenneth Massey. The application uses historical game data and linear algebra to predict the placement of teams in the NCAA basketball tournament. The application takes 2 parameters, the additional points added to teams playing home and weighting games based on margin of points. The experiment will vary these parameters and assess its effect on the accuracy of the simulated team ranking. . Repository . My GitHub repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks, my environment.yml file, a Data folder that has all the data my project needs, and an includes directory which stores libraries and files my project uses. . . Evironment.yml . Here is a look at the environment.yml file I used to create the environment for programming C++ in Jupyter Notebooks . . Building the Image at mybinder.org . With the repository set up, now we just have to give binder the url to our GitHub repository. . . What You See Post Build . Once Binder finishes building your image you will eventually be redirected to a page that looks like this . . As you can see, everything from the GitHub repository is now in this running Docker image created by Binder . Test for Notbook .

With a single environment.yml or requirements.txt file, you are able to host your notebooks on the web interactively. Visit the documentation page for details on how to use binder. . .",
